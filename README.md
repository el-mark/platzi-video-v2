# Platzi Video
This project is focused on the main view of a video social network. It is developed with React.js and it's part of a Platzi academy course. You can click the cards to see a video and play with the video tools, like the volume.

You can [see demo here](https://el-mark.github.io/platzi-video-v2/).
